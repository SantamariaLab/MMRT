Pahlavan, Buitrago, and Santamaria. "Macromolecular rate theory explains the temperature dependence of membrane conductance kinetics"
Matlab analysis and NEURON files 
Start with Q10Final.m. The file should run smoothly to generate all the figures of the paper.

We are also providing the NEURON files for the simulations of pyramidal cells. The ones in the AllenModels require you download Anaconda and instal the Allen Institute braim modeling toolkit (https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/). You can run everything from the shell (we did it Linux). Start at MegaAll.sh. 

We are providing only the data from hippocampal pyramidal neuron. We will update files. We will also uplaod to modelDB
